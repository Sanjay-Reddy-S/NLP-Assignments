Projects as part of UMass 585 course

Gender_Age_Prediction is the final project for the course. Given text samples (like hotel reviews or tweets or social media conversations) the system tries to predict the age and gender of the writer. The idea was inspired from [PAN challenge](http://pan.webis.de/clef16/pan16-web/author-profiling.html). The pdf inside the folder goes into more details and also presents the accuracies.

HW-1 is a Naive Bayes implementation

HW-2 is a Viterbi+Structured Pereceptron. 

HW-3 is regarding Word2Vec implementations and Lexicons

HW-4 is about CKY parsing on given grammar rules

Initial code blurbs in the HW and the datasets do not belong to me. Check "[nlp umass 2017](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brenocon/inlp2017/)" site.
