# NLP-Assignments
Projects as part of UMass 585 course

Gender_Age_Prediction is the final project for the course. The pdf inside the folder has more details.

HW-1 is a Naive Bayes implementation

HW-2 is a Viterbi+Structured Pereceptron. 

HW-3 is regarding Word2Vec implementations and Lexicons

HW-4 is about CKY parsing on given grammar rules

Initial code blurbs in the HW and the datasets do not belong to me. Check "[nlp umass 2017](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brenocon/inlp2017/)" site.
