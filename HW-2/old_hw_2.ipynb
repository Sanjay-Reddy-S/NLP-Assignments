Report your tagger's accuracy with these improvements. Please make a table that reports accuracy from adding different features. The first row should be the basic system, and the last row should be the fanciest system. Rows in between should report different combinations of features. One simple way to do this is, if you have 4 different feature types, to run 4 experiments where in each one, you add only one feature type to the basic system. For example:\n",

Also, if you have a feature that looks at the word at position $t$, you can make new versions of it that look to the left or right of the $t^{th}$ position in question: for example, 'word_to_left=the'.\n"
